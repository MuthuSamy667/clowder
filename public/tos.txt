    <h3>API Terms</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>Customers may access their @@NAME account data via an API (Application Program
            Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses
            @@NAME, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>You expressly understand and agree that @@NAME shall not be liable for any
                direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited
                to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if
                @@NAME has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from
                your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>

            <li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to @@NAME via the API may result in
                the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API.
                @@NAME, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of
                the API. @@NAME will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account
                owner prior to suspension.</li>

            <li>@@NAME reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily
                or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cancellation and Termination</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>@@NAME, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your
            account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other
            @@NAME service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service
            will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the
            forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. @@NAME reserves
            the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</li>

        <li>In the event that @@NAME takes action to suspend or terminate an account, we
            will make a reasonable effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents
            upon request, unless the account was suspended or terminated due to unlawful conduct.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Modifications to the Service</h3>

        <li>@@NAME reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or
            discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</li>

        <li>@@NAME shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification,
            suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Copyright and Content Ownership</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your profile

            Content that is available via the Service.</li>

        <li>You shall defend @@NAME against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or
            brought against @@NAME by a third-party alleging that Your Content, or Your
            use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property
            rights of a third-party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify @@NAME
            for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees incurred by,
            @@NAME in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding;
            provided, that @@NAME (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim,
            demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand,
            suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the
            settlement unconditionally releases @@NAME of all liability); and (c) provides
            to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.</li>

        <li>@@NAME will use best practices to keep your content secure and safe, but
            does not guarantee the availability of your data at all times. You as the content owner are responsible
            for making sure you have a backup of your data not stored in this Service.</li>

            @@NAME customer, employee, member, or officer will result in immediate
            account termination.</li>

        <li>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content,
            may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to

            constitute the entire agreement between you and @@NAME and govern your
